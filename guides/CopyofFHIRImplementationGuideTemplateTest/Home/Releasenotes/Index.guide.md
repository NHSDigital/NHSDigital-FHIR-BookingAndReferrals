## Introduction

The [Booking and Referral Standard (BaRS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/booking-and-referral-standard) is an interoperability standard that enables booking and referral information to be shared efficiently and securely between healthcare IT systems and across care settings.

**About the Payload Definition Library**

The Payload Definition Library is a key component of the standard alongside other [BaRS documentation and infrastructure components](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/booking-and-referral-standard-implementation-guide#components-of-bars). It should be used in conjunction with the [BaRS Implementation Guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/booking-and-referral-standard-implementation-guide) including [BaRS Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/booking-and-referral-standard-implementation-guide/bars-core) and the [BaRS Application page](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/booking-and-referral-standard-implementation-guide/bars-applications#bars-applications) for your use case. You can refer to our [Quick Start Guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/booking-and-referral-standard-implementation-guide#quick-start-guide) which describes the recommended resources at each stage of a typical software development lifecycle.  

A payload definition is a collection of artefacts ([documentation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/booking-and-referral-standard-implementation-guide/bars-applications), FHIR conformance profiles<link>, a FHIR message definition<link>) that are packaged together. 

Payload definitions are curated and typically assured by a relevant professional standards body, for example [PRSB](https://theprsb.org/). The payload definitions on this site are all nationally defined and developed by the BaRS programme for national level commissions. 

The Payload Definition Library allows you to browse through the different payload definitions to understand their requirements and suitability to your use case.

It also provides a mechanism for software solutions to retrieve the necessary artefacts to build and/or validate conformance of payloads, either on the fly through APIs or through periodic package downloads.
