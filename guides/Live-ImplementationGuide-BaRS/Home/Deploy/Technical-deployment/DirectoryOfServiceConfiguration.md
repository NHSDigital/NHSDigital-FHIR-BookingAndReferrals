Each service delivered by an Urgent and Emergency Care (UEC) provider has an entry in the UEC Directory of Services (DoS).  DoS Leads will continue to configure new UEC providers and services in the DoS, issuing each service with a DoS ServiceID.  If the provider is going to receive BaRS messages, the DoS ServiceId will also need to exist in the BaRS Endpoint Catalogue.
