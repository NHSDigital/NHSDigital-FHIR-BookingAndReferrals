## {{page-title}}

This section describes how the primary operations used in this Application work. 

This diagram illustrates the workflow and interactions of a referral request where a shortlist of healthcare service options are offered to a patient by a clinician:

The Application also supports a self-referral workflow:

To aid the workflows for this Application of the Standard the operations that need to be supported are:

### Directing the Referral

The referral request is directed to a broker in this Application, rather than directly to the healthcare service expected to engage with the patient. The broker negotiates the next step in the patient’s care journey, offering optional healthcare services and allowing them to choose how to proceed. Service discovery still occurs during the assessment, undertaken by the Sender, but, instead of selecting a service at this stage, selection happens later in the workflow with the broker.

The Sender will establish the patient need, identify a specific service or prepare a shortlist of healthcare services to support them, and package these in the referral request. The request is sent from the Sender to the broker (Receiver) and then onto the selected healthcare service (through [e-RS](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/e-referral-service) ). 

Alternatively, where a self-referral workflow is undertaken, the steps are the same but only one healthcare service option is included in the referral request. 

Directing the referral request will still engage the same BaRS mechanisms; utilising the NHSD-Target-Identifier. However, the Receiver is a consistent, known entity, rather than dynamically established during workflow.

*NB - The definition of the broker NHSD-Target-Identifier has not yet been agreed.*

### Make a Referral

Making a referral for this application follows the {{pagelink:core-standardpattern-1.4.0, text:standard pattern for BaRS operations}}.

The Message Definition that defines this payload for this application is: {{link:MessageDefinition-BARS-MessageDefinition-ServiceRequest-Request-Referral}}

In addition, the specific workflow parameters that are required are as follows:

<div class="nhsd-m-emphasis-box">
    <div class="nhsd-a-box nhsd-a-box--border-grey">
        <div class="nhsd-m-emphasis-box__content-box">
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Interaction</th>
                        <th>Method</th>
                        <th>Payload Focus  </th>
                        <th>Status Required (MessageHeader, ServiceRequest, Encounter)</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>ServiceRequest (Status) = active</td>
                    </tr>

					<tr>

                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>

Additionally the HTTP request header would be:

```
NHSD-Target-Identifier = {Receiver (Broker) Service Identifier}
X-Request-Id = <GUID_000001>
X-Correlation-Id = <GUID_000002>
NHSD-End-User-Organisation = {FHIR Organisation (Base64 Encoded)}
NHSD-Requesting-Practitioner = {FHIR PractitionerRole (Base64 Encoded)} 
NHSD-Requesting-Software =  {FHIR Device (Base64 Encoded)}
```

The HTTP response header would be:

```
X-Request-Id = <GUID_000001>
X-Correlation-Id = <GUID_000002>
```


### Bundle Processing - detailed

Below is a pseudo code example of how a bundle could be processed based on the above workflow variables:
