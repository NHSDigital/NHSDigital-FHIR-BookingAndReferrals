BaRS Sandbox is available from the [BaRS API specification](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/booking-and-referral-fhir/v1.3.0). It demonstrates key functionality without the overhead of security requirements, giving developers the opportunity to understand the product before progressing development.

BaRS Integration (INT) is a live-like environment for suppliers progressing with development and testing to use.  To use INT, you will need to follow the instructions to [Connect as a sender](https://simplifier.net/guide/nhsbookingandreferralstandard/Home/Build/Testing-and-Environments/Connect-as-a-sender.page.md) or [Connect as a receiver](https://simplifier.net/guide/nhsbookingandreferralstandard/Home/Build/Testing-and-Environments/Connect-as-a-receiver.page.md).

BaRS Production (PROD) is the live environment.  Suppliers will need to have progressed through assurance before applying to connect to the PROD environment.

[Path-to-Live](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/path-to-live-environments#environments) has full details of all available testing environments and the functionality they offer.
