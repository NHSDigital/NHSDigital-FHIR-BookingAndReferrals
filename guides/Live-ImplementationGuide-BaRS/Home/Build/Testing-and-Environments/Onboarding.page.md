In each BaRS workflow there are two roles: Sender and Receiver. In applications with response workflows, both parties act as a Sender and a Receiver, and will need to follow the instructions to connect to environments as both. 

The Sender obtains a token from the API-M platform to make requests of the BaRS API Proxy, which brokers the request through the Receiver, secured via TLS-MA (Transport Layer Security-Mutual Authentication).

BaRS is based on internet-first principles and there is no requirement for [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network) connectivity.
