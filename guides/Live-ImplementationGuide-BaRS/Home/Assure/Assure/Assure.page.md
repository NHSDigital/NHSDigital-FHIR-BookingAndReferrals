Assurance is central to developing a BaRS compliant solution.

The assurance process exists to ensure solutions adhere to the Standard and are compatible with each other, when they integrate in the Production environment. The compatibility guarantee is essential where interactions exist between systems which have never engaged with each before, something BaRS supports and encourages through dynamic, real-time, service discovery.

The purpose of assurance is to:
* Validate conformance to the requirements and specifications of the Standard
* Assess higher-risk and/or complex workflow scenarios, to ensure technical and clinical readiness
* Serve as a final quality assurance checkpoint prior to deployment to Production


There are limitations to this (self) assurance process, which does **not** extend to: 
* Validation of every individual workflow scenario or minor message variation within an assured solution
* Review of all message content against the Standard, either visually or through tooling. This **must** be included in supplier's functional testing 
* Regression testing of supplier solution to ensure that existing functionality has not been adversely affected
